Yallakora Match Data Scraping Project
This project scrapes football match data from the Yallakora website for a user-specified date. Using Python, Requests, and BeautifulSoup, it extracts match details such as teams, scores, and match times, then structures the data for further analysis or storage. The project demonstrates web scraping, HTML parsing, and basic data handling skills.
The scraped match data is cleaned, structured, and exported to an Excel file.

This allows the data to be easily reviewed, shared, and further analyzed using tools like Excel, Power BI, or Python.
The Excel file contains organized columns such as:
-Match date
-Team names
-Match time
-Final score
